# Blockchain-Microbond-Project


**About the Project**

What do we mean by technology for social good? Weâ€™ve partnered with the [Stellar Development Foundation](https://stellar.org/foundation) to put into practice our values and mission of leveraging technology for positive societal impact. The Blockchain Microbond Project (BMB) is a cutting-edge 24 month pilot project to research, design, and implement a community microbond built on the Stellar blockchain.

- **Microbonds** are investment instruments that are designed to be affordable and accessible. They are sold in small denominations, usually $100 or less, to enable community-led finance. They create stronger, more equitable cities by bridging the gap between financial inclusion and sustainability community development.


**The Problem**
Existing municipal bond markets maximize the interests of lenders, not borrowers.

- **Capital is exported.** Lenders extract money from local communities.
- **Lenders control terms.** Borrowers have to accept restrictions that maximize interests payments and limit repayment options.
- **Loss of local control.** Payments to borrowers around the world are prioritized over the needs of local communities.

**The Opportunity**
Microbonds build sustainable communities with local capital.

- **Money stays local.** Payments go to the community, not Wall Street.
- **Repayment flexibility.** Borrowers set the terms, not lenders.
- **Community focused.** People can invest in their community.


**Our Approach**
Blockchain technology addresses traditional bond market roadblocks with improved accessibility, transparency, and security. The Stellar Development Foundation, a US organization dedicated to equitable financial access, offers technology that supports the issuance [or distribution] of microbonds on the Stellar blockchain, fostering social impact. The BMB Project is developing a blockchain microbond platform and partnering with jurisdictions and bond issuers for seamless buying and selling, to advance financial inclusion.
